        'description'  => 'This was the very first version of my personal portfolio, created in 2024 to showcase my early web projects. I built it entirely from scratch using HTML and CSS, with a bit of JavaScript to add small interactive touches like navigation behavior or dynamic elements. The main goal was to create a clean and visually appealing layout that would present my work clearly and professionally. I focused on consistent styling, responsive design, and semantic HTML structure. While simple in functionality, this project helped me get comfortable writing CSS by hand and thinking about layout, spacing, and user experience. It also marked my first steps into using JavaScript in a real project context.',

        'description'  => 'Chocodesk was my first assignment during an internship, designed to introduce me to the company’s systems and workflows. I built the site using WordPress with a custom theme and styled it using SCSS. The process was guided by an internal instruction document and supervised by my mentor. Part of the site was based on an Adobe XD design file, which I recreated in the browser. The remaining parts I was free to complete myself, which gave me the chance to learn and experiment within a structured setup. During development, I also got some hands-on experience using phpMyAdmin, which helped me understand how WordPress manages its data behind the scenes. Through this project, I became comfortable working with WordPress, learned how to use a wide range of plugins effectively, and got a first taste of working in a team setting. I asked questions, got feedback, and learned how to turn those “is this okay?” moments into confident solutions.',

        'description'  => 'Volt4U was my second internship project, meant to test how well I could apply everything I’d learned so far. It was based on a real company and followed the same workflow the team uses for actual client sites. I built the site using WordPress with a custom theme, styled it using SCSS, and worked within the same file structure used in the company. This time, I didn’t get detailed instructions. The goal was to complete the project independently. I also got hands-on with tools like phpMyAdmin, which I used to help set up and manage the site’s hosting environment. This project gave me a real sense of what working in a professional dev team is like, and helped me build more confidence in working on my own.',

The idea came after discussing with my teacher, and I decided to create a personal gallery for stuffed animals. The site features image uploads, sorting options, pagination, and modal previews.

It allows users to write and save text locally in their browser using localStorage, so content stays even after refreshing or closing the tab. I focused on keeping the design minimal and distraction-free, while also experimenting with features like auto-saving and character limits. This project gave me a better understanding of DOM manipulation, JavaScript event handling, and client-side storage.

The site includes a responsive webshop to showcase the MIRTE robot, a form for schools to request workshops, and clear sections explaining the foundation’s mission. I worked with semantic HTML, responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid, and added interactivity with vanilla JavaScript. On the backend, I used PHP for form handling. While the site doesn’t include payment processing yet, the structure is ready for future integration. This project helped me deepen my understanding of full-stack development in a socially driven context.',
