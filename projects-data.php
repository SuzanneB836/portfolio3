    'summary' => 'A stylish WordPress website created during my internship for a fictional chocolate barista brand.',
    'description' => 'Chocodesk was my first assignment during an internship, designed to introduce me to the company’s systems and workflows. I built the site using WordPress with a custom theme and styled it using SCSS. The process was guided by an internal instruction document and supervised by my mentor. Part of the site was based on an Adobe XD design file, which I recreated in the browser. The remaining parts I was free to complete myself, which gave me the chance to learn and experiment within a structured setup. During development, I also got some hands-on experience using phpMyAdmin, which helped me understand how WordPress manages its data behind the scenes. Through this project, I became comfortable working with WordPress, learned how to use a wide range of plugins effectively, and got a first taste of working in a team setting. I asked questions, got feedback, and learned how to turn those “is this okay?” moments into confident solutions.',

'summary' => 'A practice website based on a real company, built by following the same workflow used in the team.',
'description' => 'Volt4U was my second internship project, meant to test how well I could apply everything I’d learned so far. It was based on a real company and followed the same workflow the team uses for actual client sites. I built the site using WordPress with a custom theme, styled it using SCSS, and worked within the same file structure used in the company. This time, I didn’t get detailed instructions. The goal was to complete the project independently. I also got hands-on with tools like phpMyAdmin, which I used to help set up and manage the site’s hosting environment. This project gave me a real sense of what working in a professional dev team is like, and helped me build more confidence in working on my own.',

'description' => 'KnuffelGallerij was a school project from early 2025 where I developed a full PHP website connected to a MySQL database. The idea came after discussing with my teacher, and I decided to create a personal gallery for stuffed animals. The site features image uploads, sorting options, pagination, and modal previews. Building this project gave me valuable practice integrating front-end and back-end components, managing data, and refining my PHP and JavaScript skills within a real-world context.',
